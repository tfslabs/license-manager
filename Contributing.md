# Contributing

## Environment requirements

### Git repo

To clone the repo, run, use this command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tfslabs/license-manager.git
```

### Build with Visual Studio (only for Windows)

To contribute, you may need Visual Studio 2022. Required Visual Studio 2022 SDKs:

* .NET 4.8 SDK and targeting pack
* Windows 10 SDK (10.0.18362.0) (if applicable)

## Build from source

You can open the `License Manager.csproj` to open the project in Visual Studio

However, since this project is a part of [Windows Server Management Tool](https://github.com/TheFlightSims/windowsserver-mgmttools), you may need to clone the whole repo, before using Visual Studio, because the full Visual Studio Solution are already configured with valid build configurations.
